# Pymaceuticals SCC Study Analysis
# Overview
This project involves analyzing data from a clinical study on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug Capomulin against other treatment regimens. The analysis includes data preparation, summary statistics, and various visualizations to summarize and interpret the study results.

# Background
Pymaceuticals, Inc., is a pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications. In a recent study, 249 mice with SCC tumors were treated with different drug regimens over 45 days. The goal was to evaluate Capomulin's efficacy compared to other treatments.

# Files
Module 5 Challenge files: Contains the datasets and starter code for the analysis.

# Instructions
1. Prepare the Data
- Merge mouse_metadata and study_results DataFrames into a single DataFrame.
- Identify and remove duplicate time points.
- Display the number of unique mice IDs before and after cleaning.
2. Generate Summary Statistics
- Create a DataFrame of summary statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, SEM) for each drug regimen.
3. Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts
- Generate bar charts to show the total number of timepoints for each drug regimen using both Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Create pie charts to display the distribution of male vs. female mice using both Pandas and Matplotlib.
4. Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot
- Calculate quartiles and IQR for the final tumor volumes of mice treated with Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
- Identify and highlight outliers in a box plot.
5. Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot
- Generate a line plot of tumor volume versus time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin.
- Create a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
6. Calculate Correlation and Regression
- Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
- Overlay the regression line on the scatter plot.

# Requirements
- Data Preparation: Merge datasets, clean data, and display unique mice IDs.
- Summary Statistics: Calculate and present mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM.
- Bar Charts and Pie Charts: Create and compare plots using Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Box Plot: Determine outliers and visualize tumor volume distributions.
- Line and Scatter Plots: Plot tumor volume trends and relationships with mouse weight.
- Correlation and Regression: Calculate and plot correlation and regression.

# Observations
- Capomulin vs. Other Regimens: Compare the efficacy of Capomulin with other drugs based on tumor volume reductions.
- Treatment Trends: Identify trends and variations in tumor volumes across different drug treatments.
- Correlation Insights: Analyze the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.

# Submission
- Review all generated figures and tables.
- Include at least three observations or inferences in your analysis.
- Submit the assignment and provide the GitHub repository URL for grading.

# Notes
- Include proper code source notes and acknowledgments as required.
- Utilize provided starter code and follow guidelines for plotting and analysis.
